🔹 Solution:
1️⃣ Pull the latest changes from GitHub (to merge remote changes)
bash
Copy
Edit
git pull origin main --rebase
2️⃣ Push your changes to GitHub
bash
Copy
Edit
git push -u origin main --force
⚠️ Note: --force overwrites the remote branch. Use this only if you're sure your local changes are correct.

🚀 Alternative Safe Way (Without Force Push)
If you don't want to overwrite the remote, do this:

bash
Copy
Edit
git pull origin main --rebase  # Get remote changes
git add .                      # Stage your files
git commit -m "Updated changes" # Commit again if needed
git push origin main            # Push changes
Now, your code should be pushed successfully! ✅ Let me know if you face any issues. 🚀
